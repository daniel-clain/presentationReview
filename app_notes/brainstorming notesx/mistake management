Users can create a presentation and/or speaker. But there is no delete or edit option

Mistakes can be:
* presentation/speaker typo
* multiple users making duplicate entries
* got the right name muddled up
etc

Why do mistake entries have to be dealt with
* the ui will become cluttered and confusing as a result of mistakes
* mistakes can be grown upon with quality entires, dont want these quality entries to be lost.
* if people see duplicates when they will not know the right one to use
* users who are looking to claim their speaker instance might not be sure which one is them

Issues
* I dont want the ui to be cluttered with secondary controls, primary controls should be most prominenet (primary: all features realative to the core user journey, secondary: all the helper features to facilitate good ux)
* Items appear instantly on creation thanks to websockets, which means people can instantly start using a mistake before the mistake is realised
* i dont want to give any user the ability to delete a presentation or speaker
* i dont want mistakes to just sit in the list with no way of removing them



Proposed solution
* 3 user consensus strategy:
  - a mistake can be marked as a mistake by any user
  - when the mistake is marked 3 times the resolution will take place
  - resolutions can either be: delete(not needed a all), merge(duplicate and both contain valuable records), update(typo in name)

* I think 3 user consensus is only necessary IF the record has had any data added to it by other users.
eg, if a user creates a presentation and its a typo? they should be able to delete/update by themselves. (only the creator can delete/update)
